Thanks go to
 * Miodrac Sremcevic for introducing me into some of the tricks of Saturn ring image analysis with Cassini ISS data and for producing a very nice resonance data file for the Saturn rings, here one of his publications about it:

 * Morgan Rehnberg for providing me with Miodrag's data file and answering some of my newbie questions.
